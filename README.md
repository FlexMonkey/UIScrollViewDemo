UIScrollViewDemo
================

A Node Based User Interface implemented with the Presentation Model Pattern

Work in Progress!

Long press down on the background to create a new node. Once you have two or more nodes, long press down on any and once the nodes become translucent, you're in 'relationship creation mode'. Click any other node to create a relationship between the two.
